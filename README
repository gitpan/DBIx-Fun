DBIx::Fun is a perl module to make calling database stored procedures easier.
Check out the examples to see before and after examples and even a small MVC
pattern with DBIx::Fun, Template Toolkit, and CGI::Application.

Installation:

  If you don't have Module::Build installed, you'll have to install it before
you can use this module's installer.  That is the only dependency in this
module.  The easiest way to install Module::Build is to do
"perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Build'".

There aren't really any tests at the moment.   The author recommends using
the examples to verify functionality on your systems for now.
 
  perl Build.PL
  perl Build
  perl Build test
  perl Build install
